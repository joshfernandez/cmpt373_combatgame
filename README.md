# CMPT 373 Group Project: Multi-Featured Text-Based Combat Game

An input/output, text-based program in a team of 8 people to develop a mystery game that features networking, a chat system, and the ability to make new worlds and environments. This game is a semester-long project for my CMPT 373 (Software Development Methods) class

Specific tasks included:

* Using the C++ language, object-oriented programming, and knowledge of design patterns to create the "pig latin translator" functionality for the game
* Refactoring code using methods taught in class to make it more understandable for other group members to read
* Assembing the game using GitLab's version control system and the Slack team collaboration tool to plan the different objects and routines of the program in a group of 8 people

This project was administered by Dr. Nick Sumner. You can find more information about the project at his [course website](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~wsumner/teaching/373/16/project.html).
