  - are used to a female looking like.  You can not place what it is at
  - first.  As you look her over, you see she is tall and quite slim, and
  - her figure is one to attract eyes.  As you glance again over her face
  - you notice her face is quite white, almost brilliantly so.  Her eyes
  - are black as coal, no pupil distinguishable from the iris.  She smiles
  - as she watches your mind turn to take in her appearance, and that is
  - the last piece of missing information.  You notice the small fanged
  - eyeteeth, and realize this is a vampire standing before you.  What
  - world have you stepped into?

  - The forest opens up a bit here, without actually giving of itself to field
  - or stream.  It is as if the forest were allowing you access to see the true
  - beauty that lies within.  Everything you had missed before, all the sights
  - and sounds and scents, all come to you now.  Your eyes alight upon a flock
  - of small purple birds which flutter and flow about the area.  A feathery,
  - light moss grows on the western side of the trees, giving off a faint,
  - musty smell, and small beetles work industriously in the moss, moulding it
  - into a haven from predators.  A gentle splashing sound causes your eyes to
  - drift northward, to a small pond.
